Hand drawing in android canvas with eraser.

DrawingView is extended from View & used to create a path on canvas based on movement of users fingers.

I am maintaing ArrayList of Path & Paint Object.

If User is selecting eraser then I am changing paint color from black to white & vice versa.

You can add color to it.

Yenjai.
